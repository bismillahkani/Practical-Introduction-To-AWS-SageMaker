# A practical guide to AWS SageMake
How to train and deploy machine learning models
 
# Introduction
Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service – build, train and deploy machine learning models quickly
It supports various machine learning framework – PyTorch, tensorflow, etc. 
Makes the process easier through heavy lifting of many steps of machine learning
However, it has a steep learning curve and required hands-on experience 

In this practical introduction we show how to deploy a pre-trained model on AWS and also show how to train and deploy machine learning models in AWS
